Dataset:
[spotify.csv](https://github.com/Ravikumarsivalinga/codealpha_tasks/files/14971856/spotify.csv)




Importing libraries: You import necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, seaborn, Plotly Express, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn modules for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

Loading the dataset: You load the Spotify dataset from a CSV file using Pandas read_csv function.

Data exploration: You print the first few rows of the dataset using head() to understand its structure and use info() to get an overview of the dataset's columns and data types.

Data preprocessing: You map song IDs to their corresponding names to make the data more understandable and then print a sample of the dataset.

Basic statistics: You compute basic statistics of the dataset such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, etc., using describe().

Filtering data: You filter the dataset based on a condition where 'Plays within a Month' is equal to 1, creating a new DataFrame containing only the rows where repeated plays occurred.

Visualizing filtered data: You create a bar plot to visualize the frequency of songs with repeated plays.

Preparing data for machine learning: You prepare the dataset for machine learning by converting categorical variables into numerical using one-hot encoding.

Splitting data: You split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Building and training the model: You initialize and train a RandomForestClassifier model using scikit-learn.

Making predictions: You make predictions on the test set using the trained model.

Evaluating the model: You compute the accuracy score of the model using accuracy_score.
